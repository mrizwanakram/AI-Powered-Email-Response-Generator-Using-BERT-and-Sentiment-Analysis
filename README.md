### AI-Powered Email Response Generator Using BERT and Sentiment Analysis

This project leverages artificial intelligence to automate email responses by analyzing the sentiment of incoming emails and generating contextually appropriate replies. The system is built using a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model.

#### Key Features:
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Uses TextBlob for sentiment analysis to classify email content as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.
- **BERT Tokenization and Classification:** Implements BERT for sequence classification, allowing for accurate sentiment predictions on cleaned email snippets.
- **Automated Reply Generation:** Based on the predicted sentiment, the model generates pre-defined responses tailored to the sentiment category (Positive, Neutral, or Negative).
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Trains a BERT model on email data, evaluates performance, and uses PyTorch for model implementation.
- **Interactive Interface:** Includes a Gradio-powered user interface that allows users to input email snippets and receive AI-generated replies in real-time.

#### Technologies Used:
- Python (pandas, re, torch, TextBlob)
- BERT (via Hugging Face's Transformers library)
- PyTorch for model training and evaluation
- Gradio for creating an interactive web interface

#### Project Workflow:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess email data, removing irrelevant text and stopwords.
2. **Sentiment Prediction:** Classify the sentiment of the email snippets using both TextBlob and BERT.
3. **Reply Generation:** Generate an appropriate response based on the predicted sentiment.
4. **User Interface:** Provide an easy-to-use interface for real-time sentiment analysis and reply generation.

#### Usage:
- **Training:** Run the training script to train the BERT model on your dataset.
- **Prediction:** Use the trained model to predict sentiment and generate automated email responses.
- **Interface:** Launch the Gradio interface for interactive email sentiment analysis and reply generation.

#### Example:
```python
# Example of sentiment prediction and reply generation
email_snippet = "I wasn't very satisfied with the service."
generated_reply = generate_reply(email_snippet)
print(generated_reply)
```

#### Future Enhancements:
- Implement a feedback loop to improve the accuracy of generated responses.
- Expand the reply library with more diverse and context-specific responses.
- Integrate with email services for end-to-end automation.
